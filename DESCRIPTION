Description: MICA is an R package for detecting biomarkers with concordant multi-class expression pattern across multiple omics studies from an information theoretic perspective. Our approach first detects biomarkers with concordant multi-class patterns across partial or all of the omics studies using a global test by mutual information. A post hoc analysis is then performed for each detected biomarkers and identify studies with concordant pattern.
